# Purpose
This project is meant to be used to practice important Java concepts. The concepts practiced in this project includes the following:
1. Error handling (Exceptions)
2. Logging (java.util.logging and sl4j)
3. Unit Testing (JUnit)
4. Maven Concepts

# Project Description
This project will be composed of multiple packages, each with a different App.

# Maven Concepts
* This project uses Maven as the build tool.
* I used a Maven Archetype(Template) which auto generates the structure of the project.
* I downloaded maven, added maven's bin directory on the PATH environment variable.

# Error Handling
Error Handling is one of the most important concepts in software development, yet it is poorly practiced.
I am using this project to help myself learn and practice some of the best practices of error handling.
* Throw Early, Catch late.
* Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions

# Logging
To avoid the most commonly used 'System.out.print', I will use some of the most common logging libraries and logging principles.
I will be using java.util.logging and sl4j to log messages.

# Unit Testing
Test Driven Development states that we first write the unit tests, then create implementation around those tests.
